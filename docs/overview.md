# Project Overview

The **WaterBlock Data Pipeline** automates the processing of thermal experiment data for UniSCool’s water block validation tests.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- **Automate** repetitive manual data-cleaning tasks.  
- **Unify** experimental CSV and Excel files into consistent structures.  
- **Prepare** datasets for analysis of thermal efficiency and stability.

---

## 🔬 Core Functions

1. **data_combiner.py** – merges raw data from multiple sensors or measurement systems.  
2. **data_fixer.py** – validates numeric data, replacing invalid or unrealistic values.  
3. **append_core_data.py** – integrates selected core data into a reference Excel analysis sheet.
